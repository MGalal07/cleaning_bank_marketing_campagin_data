# Bank Marketing Data Cleaning Project

## Overview

Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/). This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone, UK consumers borrowed [around £1.5 billion](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-12/Household%20Finance%20Review%202022%20Q3-%20Final.pdf), which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

You have been asked to work with a bank to clean the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward, so they would like you to ensure it conforms to the specific structure and data types that they specify. This will allow them to use the cleaned data to set up a PostgreSQL database that will store this campaign's data and facilitate the easy import of data from future campaigns.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes a CSV file named `"bank_marketing.csv"`, which you will need to clean, reformat, and split the data, saving three final CSV files. The three output files should be structured as outlined below:

### Output Files

## Conclusion

This project focuses on cleaning and structuring data to help a bank optimize their marketing campaigns for personal loans. The cleaned data will facilitate future analyses and decision-making.
